  <h2>Family Houses from The Game of Thrones</h2>
</div>

## Introduction to Project
This webpage allows any GOT fans to watch the informative videos about the lore and history of each of the Houses featured in the HBO T.V. Show - Game of Thrones.<br>
You should be able to click on the sprite graphic representing the Houses and watch as the banner changes as well a video for that house will begin to play. The video itself will appear in a "lightbox" overlaying the homepage of the website, making this a single page interactive platform. The video should display controls such as play and pause with an exit button at the top right of the lightbox.

Bug Fixes: <br>
